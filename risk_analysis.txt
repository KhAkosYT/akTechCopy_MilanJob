Game Theory Analysis for AI-Risk Problem:

Since both players play optimally:
- Tommaso moves first and distributes N soldiers across 3 territories
- Filippo sees Tommaso's distribution and responds optimally with M soldiers
- Each territory gives 1 point to the player with >= soldiers there
- Need 2+ points to win (out of 3 territories)

Key Insight:
- Filippo has perfect information and responds optimally
- Tommaso needs to find a distribution that maximizes his minimum guaranteed score

Let's think about Tommaso's strategy:
- If Tommaso puts [a, b, c] soldiers (where a+b+c = N)
- Filippo will respond to minimize Tommaso's points (maximize his own)

For Filippo to win a territory with 'x' soldiers, he needs to put at least 'x' soldiers there.

Critical observation:
- If Tommaso spreads evenly [N/3, N/3, N/3], Filippo needs to beat/match this
- If Filippo has more soldiers (M > N), he can likely win
- If they're equal (M = N), it depends on divisibility
- If Tommaso has more (N > M), he might be able to secure territories

Let me think about the optimal strategy:
- Tommaso should distribute as evenly as possible to force Filippo to spread thin
- Best distribution for Tommaso: as balanced as possible

Mathematical analysis:
- If Tommaso distributes [a, b, c] with a >= b >= c
- Filippo will try to win 2 territories with minimum soldiers
- Filippo will target the 2 smallest territories (b and c)

Optimal Tommaso strategy: distribute evenly [⌈N/3⌉, ⌈N/3⌉, ⌊N/3⌋] or similar
This forces Filippo to need at least 2*⌈N/3⌉ soldiers to win 2 territories

Key formula:
- Tommaso distributes evenly: each territory gets roughly N/3
- To win 2 territories, Filippo needs roughly 2*N/3 soldiers
- If M >= 2*⌈N/3⌉, Filippo can win
- If M < 2*⌈N/3⌉, Filippo cannot win 2 territories

Let's refine:
- Tommaso's optimal: [⌊N/3⌋+1, ⌊N/3⌋+1, ⌊N/3⌋] if N%3 >= 1
- Or variations based on N mod 3

Actually, simpler approach:
- If Tommaso puts roughly N/3 on each territory
- Filippo needs to match/beat 2 territories to win
- Filippo needs M >= 2*(N/3 + 1) to guarantee winning 2 territories

Let me reconsider with ceiling:
- Tommaso optimal: distribute to make smallest 2 territories as large as possible
- This means: [⌈N/3⌉, ⌈N/3⌉, N - 2*⌈N/3⌉]
- Filippo needs to beat the 2 smallest: needs M > 2*⌈N/3⌉ to win

Wait, let me verify with examples:
Example 1: N=3, M=3
- Tommaso: [1,1,1]
- Filippo needs 2 soldiers to match 2 territories, has 3 total
- Filippo can do [2,1,0] or [1,1,1] - gets 2 points or 3 points
- Result: Draw (both get 2 points with [1,1,1] vs [1,2,0])

Example 2: N=7, M=6
- Tommaso: [3,2,2] or similar
- Filippo needs to win 2 territories
- If Tommaso does [3,2,2], Filippo can do [0,3,3] to win 2 territories
- Result: Filippo wins

Pattern emerging:
- If M > N, Filippo likely wins
- If M = N, likely draw
- If M < N, Tommaso might win

More precise:
- Tommaso distributes evenly: smallest territory has ⌊N/3⌋
- To win 2 territories with ⌊N/3⌋ each, Filippo needs 2*⌊N/3⌋ + 2
- Actually, to win (not tie), needs 2*(⌊N/3⌋ + 1)

Let me think differently:
- Tommaso's best strategy: [⌈N/3⌉, ⌈N/3⌉, ⌊N/3⌋]
- Filippo to win 2 territories needs: 2*⌈N/3⌉ soldiers minimum
- If M >= 2*⌈N/3⌉: Filippo wins
- If M < 2*⌈N/3⌉: Need to check if Tommaso can win or draw
